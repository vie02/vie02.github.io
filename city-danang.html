                <p>The best city for living in Vietnam.</p>

                    <h1>Understand</h1>
                    <p>The city has grown rapidly in recent years and reached a population of over 1,000,000 people in 2014. There are many remnants of the "American War" leftover in Da Nang. On the way to the popular tourist spot; South Vietnam Sea, the ruins of a military base remain in the form of helicopter hangars, although these are now more easily spotted at the airport, which serves both civil and military flights.</p>
                    <p>Da Nang is often overlooked by tourists but is one of the most friendly in all of Vietnam. The famous My Khe Beach, otherwise known as China Beach for American G.I.'s, is monthly sprouting new high-rise hotels. Some of the most beautiful beaches in Vietnam are found here, and some of the friendliest people.</p>
                    <p>There are three main beaches in Danang. (A fourth one faces north into the bay and is not a place where expats usually go.) The beaches on the eastern side of the city are beautiful and developed for expat-friendly tourism. In the north is Pham Van Dong beach and Temple Resort. Temple Resort has a beautiful infinity pool under the palm trees with a view of the ocean and beach (90,000 VND). The My Kye Beach (China Beach) is at the eastern end of the Dragon Bridge road. And at Holiday Beach in the south is where you can walk into the cafe-rich An Thuong area and rent a surf board--Holiday Beach always has bigger waves than other parts of the beach.</p>
                    <p>Da Nang is also ideally positioned between Hoi An (40 minutes south) and Hue (2 hours north). Stop by and soak up the atmosphere and enjoy the unspoilt golden sandy beaches on the up and coming eastern part of Da Nang (Son Tra peninsula). Deck chairs and sun loungers can be rented on the beach for VND 20 - 30,000 per two hours. Do not forget to take your towel, etc. A handful of showers exists near where the deck chairs are.</p>
